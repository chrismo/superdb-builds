# SuperDB Builds

While [SuperDB](https://superdb.org/) is in a pre-release state, this repo
contains select pre-release builds of the `super` binary for select platforms.
The versions used for these builds are not assigned by the SuperDB team, but are
just a timestamp from the date of each build in the form of: `(last digit of the
year)(mm)(dd)`.

This repo is also used by the [asdf-superdb
plugin](https://github.com/chrismo/asdf-superdb) to provide download installs of
these pre-release builds.
